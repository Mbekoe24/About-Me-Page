    <p class="description"> I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I
        learned HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, jQuery and how to be an <b>awesome</b> Front-End Web Developer! I have a keen eye for vibrant
        design,
        conceptualizing ideas and making it come to reality with clean and artistic code has become an infatuation of
        mine. I'm also tech-enthusiast that has a deep passion for learning and tackling new challenges daily. Beyond
        web development, my multidisciplinary background helps me solve problems both analytically and creatively.
        During my spare time, I enjoy going
        to
        the
        gym, boxing, and playing basketball with friends.
